This config is set up for Prompt’s Prison. 

I have done all 135 cells and all the coordinates, including the prompts escape tunnel.

And the ox_doorlock is set up for Prompt’s Prison. 
I have configured all 345 doors from Bolingbroke Prison, including cell doors and more. 


Note: There will be no support for the door lock or prison config. 
This is to help people who want a more immersive prison experience but don't want to set up all the rooms and doors themselves. 
The rest is up to you to customize as you like.
